To set up project on new computer:

  -clone repository in new folder
  - open Eclipse, right click in Project Explorer window -> import -> General -> Existing Projects Into Workspace -> Next
  - Make sure the Select Root Directory is checked, and hit Browse, then navigate to the place where your project was cloned
  - Hit Finish, and you're done! Open the Main package, then the Application class, and then run that bad boy!
  



On Database Connection Stuff:
    
    - the database isn't set up yet, but when it is, all the query's can be run on the Connection object received from the static 
    MySQLAccess.getConnection() function.
    
    - I think the most appropriate place to run all of our queries will be in the onGenerate() method that is declared in the abstract CardType
      card.  Whenever the "Generate" button in pushed in the Main (Left) panel, the currently selected card type's onGenerate() method is called,
      so each card type can run it's own query based on whatever parameters are defined in its own panel.
  
On the GUI:

    the GUI consists of a JFrame (the MainFrame class, which extends JFrame), which contains two panels that are placed next to each other.
    The Left Panel (the Main panel) is static, (in the sense that it never chages), while the right panel is dynamic, and 
    assigned from the currently selected CardType.  Each right panel is defined in the individual CardType classes, and is displayed
    in the MainFrame by calling the method CardType.getInfoFormPanel()
    
On the CardType OO design:
    Each type of greeting card derives from the abstract class, CardType, which has a few defined methods, and a couple abstract methods
    as well. The defined methods are just basic getters. The methods you have to implement whenever you create a new CardType are the 
    setUpInfoFormPanel() and the onGenerate() method. These are the steps for creating a new CardType:
      - create you new CardType class, and make sure it extends CardType
      - make a constructor, and define the CardType's name (with the variable cardTypeName, this is what is displayed in the Main left 
          panel's JComboBox
      - Also in the constructor, make sure to call setUpInfoFormPanel()
      -That's it! The MainFrame class uses Reflection to load all the classes in the Cards package, so as soon as you've done those steps,
          you'll have a working entry in the JComboBox in the main panel.
