Just some random documentation on the project and what we have so far:


On Database Connection Stuff:
  - right now, the ip, database name, port number, username and password are all hard coded into the MySQLAccess class,
    but I eventually want to either make a config file, or have an options window in the program where you can manually enter the 
    relevant database info, and it'll save the last settings that you used.
    
    - the database isn't set up yet, but when it is, all the query's can be run on the Connection object received from the static 
    MySQLAccess.getConnection() function.
    
    - I think the most appropriate place to run all of our queries will be in the onGenerate() method that is declared in the abstract CardType
      card.  Whenever the "Generate" button in pushed in the Main (Left) panel, the currently selected card type's onGenerate() method is called,
      so each card type can run it's own query based on whatever parameters are defined in its own panel.
  
On the GUI:

    the GUI consists of a JFrame (the MainFrame class, which extends JFrame), which contains two panels that are placed next to each other.
    The Left Panel (the Main panel) is static, (in the sense that it never chages), while the right panel is dynamic, and 
    assigned from the currently selected CardType.  Each right panel is defined in the individual CardType classes, and is displayed
    in the MainFrame by calling the method CardType.getInfoFormPanel()
    
On the CardType OO design:
    Each type of greeting card derives from the abstract class, CardType, which has a few defined methods, and a couple abstract methods
    as well. The defined methods are just basic getters. The methods you have to implement whenever you create a new CardType are the 
    setUpInfoFormPanel() and the onGenerate() method. These are the steps for creating a new CardType:
      - create you new CardType class, and make sure it extends CardType
      - make a constructor, and define the CardType's name (with the variable cardTypeName, this is what is displayed in the Main left 
          panel's JComboBox
      - Also in the constructor, make sure to call setUpInfoFormPanel()
      -That's it! The MainFrame class uses Reflection to load all the classes in the Cards package, so as soon as you've done those steps,
          you'll have a working entry in the JComboBox in the main panel.
